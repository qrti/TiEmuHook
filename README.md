Touch &amp; Stylus Operation for TiEmu on Windows 7 + 8.1

Working with emulated calculators like TI89 Titanuim or Voyage 200 on
windows touch or stylus devices is nice. Unfortunately famous TiEmu
doesn't respond correct on these devices. This little project fixes it
by intercepting and resending touches and stylus clicks.
